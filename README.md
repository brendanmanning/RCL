Adds "bias" labels next to google search results to display the [AllSides](http://allsides.com) rated bias of a news site.

### Warning
May not work if Google has since changed the HTML tags the extension binded too

### Fun
I developed an (unreleased) version that sent all traffic back to a central web server so I could monitor the bias of the news sites I personally browsed. I used this data as part of a larger semester paper on the current media landscape.
